### Description ###
This is the initial idea of using machine learning libraries to perform analysis on tweets. Using TwitterAPI to pipline tweets from twitter about any topic that we choose
and analyzing features of the tweets and meta data. Due to restirctions of use in twitterAPI very minimal usages can be seen on the system since twitter only let's you use 
100.

# Requirements:

*Working Python2.7 or above

*NLTK library for machine learning
